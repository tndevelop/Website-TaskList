## Instructions

A general description of the BigLab 1 is avaible in the `course-materials` repository, [under _labs_](https://github.com/polito-WA1-AW1-2021/course-materials/tree/main/labs/BigLab1/BigLab1.pdf). In the same repository, you can find the [instructions for GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/polito-WA1-AW1-2021/course-materials/tree/main/labs/GH-Classroom-BigLab-Instructions.pdf), covering this and the next BigLab.

Once cloned this repository, instead, write your names in the above section.

Create the React project using the name `biglab1`. Edit this document as needed.

When committing on this repository, please, do **NOT** commit the `node_modules` directory, so that it is not pushed to GitHub.
This should be already automatically excluded from the `.gitignore` file, but double-check.

When another member of the team pulls the updated project from the repository, remember to run `npm install` in the project directory to recreate all the Node.js dependencies locally, in the `node_modules` folder.

Finally, remember to add the `final` tag for the final submission, otherwise it will not be graded.
